Questions (from lab handout):

1. Problem 6.4 (ignore the average case)
    The best case scenario for bubble sort would be if all the values in the list
    are already in their desired positions in relation to one another. In this
    case, bubble sort would only need to run once through the list, which would
    be of O(n), because no values would need to be switched and the list will be
    deemed sorted. The worst case scenario would be if all the values are in the
    exact opposite order in which they need to be sorted (eg. numbers are in
    descending order when they need to be in ascending order). In this case, the
    time complexity would be of O(n^2) because every value in the list of n
    values would need to be sorted n times.

2. Problem 6.13 (for those sorts that are not stable, explain why)
    Insertion sort is stable, because similar to bubble sort, when two equal
    values are compared to one another, no change occurs. Selection sort is also
    stable because when trying to find either the smallest or largest value in
    the array and it encounters another equally small or large value, no change
    occurs and the current value is still considered either the smallest or
    largest. Merge sort is
