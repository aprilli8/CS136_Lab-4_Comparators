# Lab 4 High-level Feedback
 * Great job! üëç
 * Nice work organizing your code into the MyVector, Student, and AnalyzeBook classes.
   I would definitely suggest breaking your long main in AnalyzeBook into helper methods
   though (see code for more details).
 * (-0.5) Good job commenting, but make sure to have a comment header with an overall
   description of the class at the top of each program.
